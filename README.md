# Test windows_capture crate

This is a toy project to test the
[windows_capture](https://github.com/NiiightmareXD/windows-capture) crate.

The idea is to pass a more complex context flag that allows me to set the file
name and resolution from the starting caller. Also, I want to test cancelling
recording via channel.
